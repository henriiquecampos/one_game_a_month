# One Game a Month

This year of 2018 Pigdev Studio's goal is to develop one game every month for 12 months. Starting on February's 10th we will be participating in every #1GAM, a game jam about developing one game every month. Convenient isn't it?

## February theme: Music
A platformer where the player guides a bard in their mission to understand the musical world.

The core mechanics:
* player must match a note, with pitch and duration
* player has to find out where are the birds that sing said notes
* to complete a level, the player must find out and match every bird's melody

## March theme: Permanence

An arcade action game where the player fights fat food trying in a never ending effort to stay in diet.

The core mechanics:

* player must keep a fatness bar under 100%, the closer to 100% the slower the gameplay
* player scores by ~~PUNCHING FAT FOOD IN THE FACE~~ avoiding the consume of fat food
  * if the player succeed in hiting a food he/she scores
  * is just avoiding, nothing will happen
